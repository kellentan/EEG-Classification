# EEG-Classification
Repository contains code for the final project of the concurrent graduate course EC ENGR C147/C247: Neural Networks and Deep Learning (taken Winter 2022 with Prof. Kao). The project uses electroencephalography four-class motor data taken from the 2008 Brain-Computer Interface IV competition to classify four types of patient action: moving the left hand, moving the right hand, moving both feet, and moving the tongue. The two deep learning architectures explored include a data-augmented convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) using a doubly-stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, and a data-augmented variational autoencoder convolutional neural network (VAE-CNN). The CRNN architecture is able to obtain testing accuracies upwards of 70%.
